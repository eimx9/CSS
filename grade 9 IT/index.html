<font size="3" color="blue">

<font size="3" color="red">

    <p>Angelica was used in Europe for hundreds of years as a cure for everything from the bubonic plague to indigestion. It is thought that adding it to a ritual bath will break spells and hexes and has often been used to ward off evil spirits in the home. Because it resembles celery in odor and appearance, angelica sometimes is known as wild celery. Alternative medicine practitioners say Angelica is a good herbal tea to take for colic, gas, indigestion, hepatitis, and heartburn. It is useful to add in remedies for afflictions of the respiratory system, as well as liver problems and digestive difficulties.</p>

    <p>Flowers of bamboo are rarely seen. Some species of bamboo develop flowers after 65 or 120 years. Interesting fact about flowering is that all plants of one bamboo species develop flowers at the same time, no matter where they are located in the world.Bamboo releases 30% more oxygen into the atmosphere and absorbs more carbon dioxide compared to other plants. Because of these features, bamboo greatly decreases amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and cleans the air.</p>

The completely unrelated but similarly named black cohosh also has estrogenic and abortifacient properties and was often combined with blue cohosh to terminate a pregnancy.</p>

Sunflower seeds are rich in oil, which they store as a source of energy and food; its seeds are crushed to produce sunflower oil for cooking.</p>
